Device-Tree bindings for Power Device on MediaTek PMIC RTC

The power device is responsible for externally power off or on the remote
MediaTek SoC through the a tiny circuit block BBPU inside PMIC RTC.

Required parent node:
- rtc
	For MediaTek PMIC RTC bindings, see:
	Documentation/devicetree/bindings/mfd/mt6397.txt

Required properties:
- compatible: Should be one of follows
	"mediatek,mt6323-rtc-poweroff": for MT6323 PMIC
	"mediatek,mt6397-rtc-poweroff": for MT6397 PMIC

Example:

	rtc {
		compatible = "mediatek,mt6323-rtc";

		power-off {
			compatible = "mediatek,mt6323-rtc-poweroff";
		};
	};
