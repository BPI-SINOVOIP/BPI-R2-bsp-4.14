Device-Tree bindings for MediaTek PMIC based RTC

MediaTek PMIC based RTC is an independent function of MediaTek PMIC which
is working as a multi-function device (MFD). And the RTC can be configured and
set up via PMIC wrapper bus. Which is also common resource shared among the
other functions present on the PMIC.

For MediaTek PMIC wrapper bus bindings, see:
Documentation/devicetree/bindings/soc/mediatek/pwrap.txt

Required parent node:
- pmic
  For MediaTek PMIC MFD bindings, see:
  Documentation/devicetree/bindings/mfd/mt6397.txt

Required properties:
- compatible: Should be one of follows
	"mediatek,mt6323-rtc": for MT6323 PMIC
	"mediatek,mt6397-rtc": for MT6397 PMIC

Optional child node:
- power-off
  For Power-Off Device for MediaTek PMIC RTC bindings, see:
  Documentation/devicetree/bindings/power/reset/mt6397-rtc-poweroff.txt

Example:

	pmic {
		compatible = "mediatek,mt6323";

		...
		rtc {
			compatible = "mediatek,mt6323-rtc";

			power-off {
				compatible = "mediatek,mt6323-rtc-poweroff";
			};
		};
};
